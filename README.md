# Friends-classifier

## Summary

This project aims to classify characters from the TV show "Friends" based on uploaded photos. 

It employs Python, OpenCV for image processing, and machine learning classifiers, including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, and Logistic Regression, to classify the characters. The classifiers are trained on a labeled dataset of character images, and the system can predict and display which character from the show is depicted in an image.
